        title: 'Is Cancun Safe?', 
        content: '  Cancún is the most popular city in Mexico for travelers, welcoming almost four million visitors in 2021 (pre-pandemic, in 2019, it was over six million). The second most popular destination, Mexico City, only saw half of that number. With numerous direct flights from various cities in the United States and lovely beaches that hug turquoise waters, it\’s not really a surprise that this city of nearly 900,000 people is so popular. While the media tends to paint in broad strokes when it comes to Mexico and safety, there are plenty of safe places to travel in Mexico. Cancún is one of them.  It\’s not like San Pedro Sula in Honduras or Ciudad Juárez on the Mexican-US border, where you might encounter robbers or violence just by strolling down the street.  That said, of the most dangerous cities in Mexico, Cancún comes in at number six in terms of the number of homicides per 100,000 people. To put this into perspective, the most dangerous city in Mexico is Tijuana, with 138 murders per 100,000 people. Cancún has 64.  While that may seem worrying, keep in mind that there are several cities in the US with comparable stats (St. Louis had 65 homicides per 100,000 people in 2019; Baltimore saw 58).  Fortunately for travelers, most of the violent crime in Cancún is the result of drug cartels and occurs far from the tourist zones (and rarely involves tourists). The vast majority of travelers will come and go without incident.  But that doesn\’t mean you can travel carelessly here.  To help you understand more about the city and decide if you feel comfortable visiting, here is everything you need to know to stay safe in Cancún.',

        title: 'Where to Stay in Medellin: The Best Neighborhoods For Your Visit', 
        content: 'The city of Medellín is hugely popular with travelers and digital nomads (that comes with some problems but that\’s for another post). It\’s the second-largest city in Colombia.  I absolutely love the city. It has a world-class restaurant scene, there\’s plenty of nightlife, it\’s affordable, and there\’s a large digital nomad community so it\’s easy to connect with other travelers and remote workers.  Of course, it wasn\’t always this way. In the 1980s, Medellín was the most dangerous city on the planet, thanks to Pablo Escobar’s infamous drug cartel. But, since then, the murder rate has dropped by an astounding 95%, and the poverty rate has decreased by 66%.  In the last decade, Medellín has been showered with awards due to its rapidly improving infrastructure, public transportation system, and other features that have made the city an extremely livable place. This is not the Medellin of the past.  That said, travelers should still be careful in Medellín — mostly by avoiding the outskirts of town and certain neighborhoods at night where crime can still be an issue. Location is important in Medellín, and that\’s why you have to choose where you stay wisely when looking for accommodation there.  Below, I\’ll show you exactly where to stay in Medellín, so you can plant yourself in the best neighborhood, based on your travel style, budget, and interests.  First, though, let me answer a few frequent questions I get:',

        title: 'Mini Funfetti Cheeesecakes', 
        content: ' What says celebration more than sprinkles? In the baking world, they\’re the perfect way to dress up your baking for a special occasion. And a Funfetti Cheesecake is absolutely perfect for a celebration. Make them mini, and they\’re even more fun and adorable!  These little sweet bites are simply a vanilla cheesecake all dressed up with colorful sprinkles. Add a dollop of whipped cream and even more sprinkles for a fun batch of mini desserts. Maybe the best part about this confetti cheesecake recipe? How easy it is to make! You\’ll skip the traditional graham cracker crust in favor of using a whole Golden Oreo for the crust. (Much like Cookies and Cream Cheesecakes!) Then just mix some simple ingredients for the filling. No springform pan, long bake times, or water bath, either. They bake in about half an hour in a muffin pan. And the mini size means no slicing when it\’s time to serve! And, of course, sprinkles! Standard rainbow sprinkles are all you need here. But you can pick a specific mix of colors to match your celebration, too. (If you can\’t get enough sprinkles, you must try Sprinkle Crinkle Cookies, too!) These Mini Funfetti Cheesecakes are a fun alternative to birthday cakes. Honestly, they\’re a great choice for all kinds of happy events. They\’re just so happy and fun! If you have fond memories of whipping up a funfetti cake mix, then these are perfect little bites of nostalgia.',

        content: ' Sony is acquiring mobile game developer Savage Game Studios, the company announced on Monday. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

        content: 'A clean home is a happy home. I think about this statement a lot — especially as a cleaning editor. Allow me to reintroduce myself. My name is Stephanie Nguyen, the cleaning and organizing editor for Apartment Therapy, and I love sharing and finding cleaning tips, organizational hacks, and decluttering tricks with you, our readers. I know that the act of cleaning — from the chores you do every day to the ones done seasonally — goes beyond cleanliness. It\’s how you care for your home, and in turn yourself. And when you declutter, it\’s not just the usual suspects that pile up, such as worn-out clothes or boxes upon boxes. Sometimes, you\’re parting ways with the emotional memories that cling to the physical items of your spaces, like the T-shirt from my college newspaper days that I never wear but keep tucked away in a box or the overflowing bin of handwritten notes, letters, cards, and post-its from people — old friends, coworkers, loved ones — that have at one point touched my life. Decluttering is often necessary as it allows you time to check in on your items and say goodbye to things that take up much-needed space (and time) or no longer bring joy into your life. Sometimes the toughest part of the decluttering process is knowing how and where to start. But, once you build momentum, you can tackle almost anything. Luckily, you don\’t have to do it alone. Apartment Therapy\’s annual Decluttering Cure begins in just a few weeks — and it\’s free to join in on the fun! This free 14-day program is designed to help you conquer the clutter in your home, step-by-step, and rejoice in a neater, more organized space. ',

        title: 'How Zen Koans Unlock the Gate of Enlightenment', 
        content: 'Karate. Karaoke. Kimono. Like other familiar Japanese k-words, it\'s easy to reduce Zen koans into a Westernized novelty item (the Japanese word koan comes from the Chinese gongan, which means "public case"). Hmm. It\'s tempting to be a smart aleck, like Bart Simpson, or to dismiss the supposedly "deep" question as ridiculous or nonsensical. But if you take a minute to explore the long history and tradition of koans in Zen Buddhism — the first collections of Zen koans were compiled 1,000 years ago — you\'ll have a new appreciation for the power of these ancient riddles to unlock deep spiritual understanding, perhaps even enlightenment. To dig deeper, we spoke with Steven Heine, a religion professor at Florida International University who has written many excellent books about Zen Buddhism and koans, including the accessible primer "Zen Koans." Zen Buddhism is a school of Buddhism that was first developed in seventh-century China (where it\'s called Chan) and later took root in Japan and Korea in the 13th century. In Japanese, Zen means "meditation," and it\'s through countless hours of focused meditation that a Zen practitioner hopes to achieve enlightenment, a Buddha-like state of absolute understanding and detachment. But that won\'t happen through meditation alone. At the heart of Zen Buddhism is the relationship between the student and the teacher or master. The job of the master is to help the student shed layers of ignorance, stubbornness and illusions to expose the "Buddha within," the knowledge and wisdom that has always been there waiting to be revealed.',
